# Bookbank
<h2> Introduction: </h2>
<p>
Using banks can be a very exhausting and tiring experience for the customers due to how crowded it can get and time consuming,
  Bookbank solves this problem by making a platform that will show the available time slots and days for a certain bank,
  and the users can login and reserve an appointment in said bank.
